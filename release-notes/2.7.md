# IaaS Windows VMAgent 2.7 Releases

The [Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/agent-windows) is a secure, lightweight process that manages virtual machine (VM) interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. The VM Agent has a primary role in enabling and executing Azure virtual machine extensions. VM Extensions enable post-deployment configuration of VM, such as installing and configuring software. VM extensions also enable recovery features such as resetting the administrative password of a VM. Without the Azure VM Agent, VM extensions cannot be run.
